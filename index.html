            <h3>My Cello: <em>Cella</em></h3>
            <p>Cella is not my first family member, but she is the first one I named.</p>

            <p>I love to chill with <b><em>Cella</em></b> (pronounced "chella"), my cello. We love playing with others and 
               for others. She is especially designed for playing Jazz. She is a 'Kay' cello. Her front is actually 
               laminate rather than solid wood. I hope to learn to play well enough to make some great Jazz music 
               with her.
            </p>
            <p  id="cello">I was introduced to the cello by a friend who needed someone to look after her instruments while she 
               traveled Europe for three months. She allowed me to actually play with her cello, even teaching me a 
               few things before she left. I took advantage of the opportunity by signing up for lessons and fell in 
               love with the insturment! It was my mid-life reinvention. As time neared when I would have to return 
               my friend's cello, I realized I did not want to give it up. So, doing the only thing I could think of, 
               I prayed, closed my eyes, opened a paper phone book, and stuck my finger on a page. As fortune would 
               have it, it landed on an add for a violin shop. Even though it was after hours, I called and left a
               message. The owner called the next day to say he didn't usually sell cellos, but had two of them 
               that he had been given that were in pieces. If I could wait a couple weeks he could have one ready 
               for me to try. As a luthier, he was able to repair both of them and I selected the one that sounded 
               the best to my ear. Mind you, I was a total beginner, but I truly believe I did well. Even now, 
               when the opportunity arises for us to play together, the gentleman frequently comments that he did 
               not charge me enough for my cello because it sounds so good!

               <h3>My autoharps: <em>Otto</em>, <em>Princess Di</em>, & <em>Babe</em></h3>

               </figure>
               <p><b><em>Otto</em></b> (on the right), is a chromatic autoharp. He has 21 chords. He was a wedding 
                     present from my first husband. He has been a part of my family the longest.
               </p>
               <p><b><em>Princess Di</em></b> (on the left), is my diatonic autoharp. She has 15 chords. I rescued 
                  her from a thrift shop in Salt Lake City, UT. She needed a lot of work. I learned how to re-felt 
                  and move the chord bars as I repaired her. She can only play in certain key signatures because 
                  some of her strings are duplicated to produce a fuller, more resonant sound.
               </p>
               <p><b><em>Babe</em></b> (front center), is my baby autoharp. She only has 5 chords. I first learned 
                  to play one like her in third grade. They no longer manufacture autoharps like her, so she is truly 
                  a collector's instrument.

               <p><b><em>Duke</em></b> is a concert ukulele. I was introduced to my first ukulele in the fifth grade and kept it for 
                  many years until my first husband broke it. At that point I vowed to one day replace it. I purchased 
                  Duke many years later as a replacement for that first ukulele. He is the pretty one!</p>
               <p id="peptoPink"><b><em>Peppi</em></b> is a soprano ukulele. She was rescued from a thrift store in Portland, OR. Peppi is hard to 
                  miss because of her Pepto Bismol color.</p>

               <h3>Piano and Keyboards:</h3>
            <p>I have an antique piano that has seen better days. She is an upright grand and is over 100 years old! 
               I found her on my birthday, for free, on a FaceBook listing! I paid professional piano movers to bring 
               her home. Her once ivory keys are all gone. At one time they were replaced with plastic covers, but 
               many of them have come off. I play even though some have covers and some do not. She has beautiful tone.
               <br><br>
               I took piano lessons as a child, but didn't progress very far. My practicing in the evenings caused problems 
               with family TV time, so I gave up, promising myself I would pick it up again when I had my own home. This 
               year (2023), I kept that promise to myself, and started taking lessons as an adult.
               <br><br>
               I also have 3 keyboards of various sizes. One I purchased. The other two were given to me. They each 
               have different capabilities.

            <h3>Other extended family: Trumpet, Violin, Jews Harp, thumb piano, recorder, 2 harmonicas, and <em>Guitar Hero</em></h3>
            <p>The <em>trumpet</em> came to live with me when I was in St. Louis. My youngest son started to play while in school, 
               but there was no middle school music program for him when we moved to Kansas City, MO.
            </p>
            <p>The <em>violin</em> was my sister's before I purchased it for my oldest child to learn on. It is mostly shared at 
               this point. Perhaps one day I will learn to play it too.
            </p>

            <p>My <em>Jews Harp (a.k.a Jaw Harp)</em> (above), came home with me from my church mission to Italy. I love how it feels 
               as it vibrates on the lips when being played. The origin of the name has been connected it to the Cleveland dialectal 
               gew-gaw, related to the Old Norse giga (compare modern Swedish giga). Others have suggested it derives from an early 
               English or German word jue or jaws. The synonym jaw harp may have therefore come first.

            <p>I purchased my tiny <em>Thumb piano (a.k.a Kalimba)</em> this past Christmas as a present to myself. I picked up one for each of 
               my grandchildren too.
            </p>
            <p>My <em>recorder</em> belonged to one of my kids from a music experience in school. Due to a birth defect, I cannot 
               play wind instruments very well. I am hoping that one day, if I get to pass through the pearly gates, I 
               will be blessed with the ability to play wind instruments.
            </p>
            <p>The <em>harmonicas</em> were another thing my kids and I had fun with.</p>
            <p>I also have a box of various noisemakers such as <em>marimbas, maracas, castanets, and a tambourine</em>.</p>
            <div >
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">As a techie, of course I would need to express myself by having fun with music. While at a church party, I was
               introduced to <em><big>Guitar Hero</big></em> and had to have one for myself. Mine is the old Wii version with two Drum sets, 
               3 guitars, plus the microphone.
